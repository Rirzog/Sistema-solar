    <h3>How to make it!</h3>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Add onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, olives, sofrito, saz√≥n, garlic, oregano, and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until mixture thickens, about 15 minutes.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Roll empanada disks on a lightly floured surface until 1/2 inch larger in diameter. Spoon about 1 tablespoon meat mixture into the middle of each disk. Moisten the disk edges with water, fold in half over filling to form a half-moon, and pinch to seal (or seal with a fork).</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Heat 2 1/2 inches corn oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Working in batches, fry empanadas until crisp and golden brown, flipping once, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain.</p>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>Crispy empanadas, guaranteed! If you don't have a deep-fry thermometer, you can still estimate the temperature of the oil. Just place the handle of your wooden spoon (or a wooden chopstick) into the oil. If a steady stream of bubbles emerges from the wood, the oil is perfect. If the oil starts rapidly bubbling, or if only a few bubbles are present, then the oil is too hot or too cold, respectively.</p>
